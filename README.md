Rabbit Transport | The Odin Project

Page of a fictional transportation company intended to solidify knowledge obtained through The Odin Project's course. 
"Landing Page" task 

The header consists in the company's logo and a simple navigation bar at the end.
The 'content' part consists in 4 panels:
  - a simple headline and paragraph about Rabbit's expansion as well as a presentation video (just Disney Pets' movie, but let's pretend);
  - some reasons to why should the customers hire the company;
  - a quote;
  - a call-to-action.
And last, a footer with my thanks to TOP.

I used only flexbox to create it. It went well as I did not need other techniques. The growth and shrinkage concepts are still a little difficult for me, but as they were not much needed here, it went all ok.
